When you find a puzzle you want to play you can click the play button and a timer starts to see how fast you can complete the puzzle. If you get stuck along the way you can click the 'help' button to get one square filled in. Be careful how many times you use the help button because it will keep track of how many times you "cheat" and will show in your dashboard.
